I am a research scientist specializing in the development of innovative electrochemical methodologies that integrate organic chemistry, laboratory automation, and machine learning for sustainable materials discovery. With a Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry obtained in 2020, I have dedicated my career to advancing next-generation energy storage technologies while pioneering environmentally friendly synthetic approaches.

During my doctoral studies, I developed novel electrochemical decarboxylative cross-coupling methods for synthesizing important pharmaceutical and materials science intermediates, establishing more sustainable alternatives to traditional synthetic approaches. Following my Ph.D., I expanded my expertise through postdoctoral training at Guangzhou National Laboratory, where I mastered the integration of laboratory automation, high-throughput experimentation, and artificial intelligence in chemical research. 

Currently, as a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University, I have developed an automated high-throughput electrochemical characterization platform that combines robotic systems with machine learning algorithms. This platform, published in [*Science Advances*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu4391), represents a paradigm shift in how energy materials research is conducted, enabling rapid discovery and optimization of battery materials and electrolytes.

My research interest is in developing sustainable synthetic methods and accelerating materials discovery through intelligent automation. Feel free to [reach out to me](dangerlin100@gmail.com) if you'd like to learn more about me. Cheers!

By the way, I am the father of two cats, Oscar (exotic shorthair) and Paper (normal Munchkin).
